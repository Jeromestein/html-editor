# **Grade Conversion Rules**

Version: 2025.2  
Scope: All Credential Evaluation Reports (General & Course-by-Course)  
Compliance Standards: AICE Standards 2025, AACRAO EDGE Guidelines

## **I. Credit Conversion Methodology**

AICE does not mandate a fixed country-to-credit conversion table. Instead, it requires evaluation agencies to adhere to the **"Full-time Load"** principle. This is the golden rule for all conversions.

### **1\. The Golden Rule**

Regardless of the credit system on the original transcript (whether 60 ECTS, 120 CATS, or raw credits from China), the conversion to U.S. semester credits must align with the following ranges:

| U.S. Semester Credits | Equivalent Full-time Duration | Notes |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **30 \- 32 Credits** | **1 Academic Year** | Standard Benchmark |
| **15 \- 16 Credits** | **1 Semester** |  |
| **120 \- 128 Credits** | **4-Year Bachelor's Degree** | Total graduation credits usually fall in this range |
| **60 \- 64 Credits** | **2-Year Master's Degree** |  |

### **2\. Universal Conversion Formulas (Industry Standards)**

Based on best practices observed across AICE member agencies (e.g., Scholaro, Ucredo, FCSA), the following formulas serve as the default logic when specific conversion tables are unavailable.

#### **A. Higher Education (University Level)**

* **Core Logic**: Based on **Full-time Academic Year**.  
* **Formula**:  
  * **1 Year (Full-time)** \= **30 \- 32 U.S. Semester Credits**  
  * **1 Semester (Full-time)** \= **15 \- 16 U.S. Semester Credits**  
* **Operational Method**:  
  1. **Verify Status**: Confirm from the transcript that the academic year represents full-time study.  
  2. **Normalization**: Regardless of the original credit total (e.g., China: 40-50 credits, Europe: 60 ECTS, UK: 120 CATS), the converted total **must fall within the 30-32 range**.  
  3. **Coefficient Calculation**: Coefficient \= 30 / Total Original Credits. Apply this coefficient to each individual course.

#### **B. Secondary Education (High School)**

* **Core Logic**: Based on the **Carnegie Unit**.  
* **Formula**:  
  * **1 Year Course (meets daily/5 times per week)** \= **1.0 Unit (or 10 Credits)**  
  * **1 Semester Course** \= **0.5 Unit (or 5 Credits)**  
* **Operational Method**:  
  * **Count Subjects**: Identify core academic subjects (e.g., Math, Language, Science). If a student takes 5 core subjects for a full academic year, the total is **5.0 Units**.

## **II. Grade Conversion Scales**

The following are general conversion scales for major educational systems. Note that these are **suggested standards**; evaluators may adjust based on the specific grading severity of the institution.

### **1\. China \- Percentage Scale (Standard)**

| Original Score | Description | U.S. Grade | GPA Points |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **85 \- 100** | Excellent | **A** | 4.00 |
| **75 \- 84** | Good | **B** | 3.00 |
| **60 \- 74** | Pass | **C** | 2.00 |
| **0 \- 59** | Fail | **F** | 0.00 |

*Note: For some prestigious universities (Project 985/211), 80-89 may correspond to B+ or A-; refer to the transcript legend.*

### **2\. India \- Class/Division System**

| Original Score / Class | Description | U.S. Grade |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **60 \- 100** (First Class) | First Division | **A** |
| **50 \- 59** (Second Class) | Second Division | **B** |
| **40 \- 49** (Pass Class) | Pass | **C** |
| **0 \- 39** | Fail | **F** |

### **3\. Latin America (0-10 Scale, e.g., Brazil/Colombia)**

| Original Score | U.S. Grade |
| :---- | :---- |
| **9.0 \- 10.0** | **A** |
| **7.0 \- 8.9** | **B** |
| **5.0 \- 6.9** | **C** |
| **0.0 \- 4.9** | **F** |

### **4\. Russia/Former Soviet System (5-Point Scale)**

| Original Score | Russian Description | U.S. Grade |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **5** | Otlichno (Excellent) | **A** |
| **4** | Khorosho (Good) | **B** |
| **3** | Udovletvoritelno (Satisfactory) | **C** |
| **2** | Neudovletvoritelno (Fail) | **F** |

## **III. Course Level Designation**

Accurately marking **Lower (L)** and **Upper (U)** divisions in Course-by-Course reports is critical for transfer credit.

### **1\. Definitions**

* **LD (Lower Division)**: Introductory courses, equivalent to Freshman/Sophomore year in the U.S.  
* **UD (Upper Division)**: Advanced/Specialized courses, equivalent to Junior/Senior year in the U.S.  
* **GR (Graduate)**: Graduate-level courses.

### **2\. Determination Logic**

* **4-Year Degrees**:  
  * Year 1 \= **L**  
  * Year 2 \= **L**  
  * Year 3 \= **U**  
  * Year 4 \= **U**  
* **3-Year Degrees (e.g., UK, Australia)**:  
  * Year 1 \= **L**  
  * Year 2 \= **U** (some may be L)  
  * Year 3 \= **U**  
* **China 3-Year Diploma (Zhuanke)**:  
  * Generally evaluated as **L** (Lower Division), unless specific core major courses are determined to be Upper Division by the receiving institution.

## **IV. Required Citations**

To comply with AICE 2025 Standards, every report must include a bibliography. AET policy is to utilize accessible, authoritative resources to supplement internal databases.

**Action Plan: Every report must automatically include at least the following three citations:**

1. **AACRAO Publications / EDGE**: *Referenced for general placement recommendations and educational system structure.*  
2. **Ministry of Education of \[Country Name\]**: *Referenced for institutional recognition and official curriculum standards (e.g., CHSI for China, UGC for India).*  
3. **Official Transcripts/Diplomas**: *Submitted by the applicant and verified for authenticity.*

**Alternative Authoritative Resources (For Internal Verification):**

* **Nuffic (The Dutch Organisation for Internationalisation in Education)**: Use Country Modules for detailed credit conversion guidance.  
  * *Citation Format: Nuffic. (Year). Country Module: \[Country Name\].*  
* **ECE Connection / WES Tools**: Use for cross-verification of grading scales (do not cite directly in report).

## **V. Remarks & GPA Calculation Rules**

* **GPA Calculation**: Use the standard 4.0 scale. Formula: Sum(Credit × Grade Points) / Total Credits.  
* **Exclusions**:  
  * "Pass/Fail" (P/F) courses are counted for credit but excluded from GPA calculation.  
  * Military Training and PE courses are generally included in GPA unless otherwise specified by the client or receiving institution.
